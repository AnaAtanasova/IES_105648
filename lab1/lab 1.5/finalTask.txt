a)Maven has three lifecycles: clean, site and default. Explain the main phases in the default lifecycle.
validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
compile - compile the source code of the project
test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

b)Maven is a build tool; is it appropriate to run your project to?
Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. 
Maven can also be used to build and manage projects written in C#, Ruby, Scala, and other languages. 
The Maven project is hosted by the Apache Software Foundation, where it was formerly part of the Jakarta Project.

c)What would be a likely sequence of Git commands required to contribute with a new feature to a given project?
(i.e., get a fresh copy, develop some increment, post back the added functionality)
